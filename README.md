# Power-BI-Dashboard
Hello everyone,

I am sharing my first Power BI Desktop project, Adventure Works Report, which provides insights into the overall performance of Adventure Works, a fictional global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories. This is a part of the Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence (2023) course by Maven Analytics on Udemy, instructed by Chris Dutton & Aaron Parry

The Key Objective of this course:

It covered all aspects of Power BI Desktop, from pulling the data from the source and editing it in the power query, building relationships between the data, then Creating DAX measures and finally creating an interactive dashboard. ðŸ“Š
By following these steps, I was able to showcase my data visualization skills and gain valuable insights into the Adventure Works data set.

The steps involved in the analysis:
1. Data Extraction: Gathering all the data to Power Query.
2. Data Cleaning: Checking for duplicate values, errors, and patterns.
3. Data Transformation: Adding extra columns to calculate certain measures such as the Start of the Week, Start of the Month, Year, and Average Retail Price, among others.
4. Data Modeling: Building one-to-many relationships between data tables.
5. Data Processing/Manipulation: Creating new calculated columns and measures such as Total Transactions, Total Profit, Total Returns, Return Rate, Revenue Target, 90-Day Revenue, etc.
6. Data Visualization: Building an interactive dashboard with KPIs, trends, charts, and a matrix.
